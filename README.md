Next month you decide to launch 5 more branches and stated selling other products.

U decide to make 1000 more branches.Now you need to store all kinds of information like
details of the people who you are working with,branch location, etc.
Your local server's cant handle this much of storage and computing.Storing this locally would 
you need bigger servers,database admins,server technicians etc to handle the data in your company.


Here's where could computing comes into picture.
Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centres, companies can rent 
access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.
One benefit of using cloud-computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and 
complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for 
what they use, when they use it.
